Depending on who you talk to or where you work, definitions can vary.<b> The important thing is consistency.</b> ARR is shiny and will get a lot of attention, so you better know what you're doing.</div>"

    "I'll explain how it all works, show some mistakes I've made, and make recommendations. Whether you are 12 sheets deep in excel or lost in spark configurations, as long as you are dealing with ARR on the data side, this is written for you. I'll start with what ARR is and how to calculate it. Then I'll dive into the customer cube. Build on top of our cube with all the different cuts and measures.\n",

    "In terms of Finance and accounting, ARR is not to be confused with Revenue Recognition. ARR is Non-[GAAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_standard). That distinction, I think, adds to a lot of chatter. [This article](https://sensiba.com/resources/insights/what-you-need-to-know-about-annual-recurring-revenue-and-gaap-revenue-recognition/) explains the difference well. Which means, everything I explain is not a law or notable standard. I'm just putting on paper everything I've been taught and been able to soak up from some pretty smart people."
